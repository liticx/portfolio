# The Rising Threat of SIM Swapping Attacks

SIM swapping, also known as SIM hijacking, is a type of account takeover fraud that enables hackers to gain access to your smartphone and the sensitive personal data it contains. By exploiting weaknesses in two-factor authentication and social engineering phone carrier employees, SIM swappers can essentially take over your phone number and intercept everything tied to it.

## What is SIM Swapping?
SIM swapping refers to fraudsters contacting your mobile carrier and convincing them to transfer your phone number over to a SIM card they control. This grants them full access to any calls, texts, emails and app accounts associated with that number.

Once the SIM swap is completed, all inbounds calls and messages will be routed to whatever phone the hackers inserted your SIM card into. They then leverage this to bypass two-factor authentication and reset the passwords to your email, social media, financial accounts and more.


## Why is SIM Swapping So Dangerous?

SIM swapping exposes victims to  wide range of threats and account breaches, including:

Email/social media account takeovers - With access to victim's texts and calls, hackers can trigger password resets and intercept confirmation codes.

Financial theft - Retirement accounts, cryptocurrency wallets and bank accounts could all be drained once SIM swappers gain entry.

Identity fraud - Personal info tied to the phone number can be leveraged to open new fraudulent accounts.

Sensitive data theft - Photos, messages, contacts and other private data are exposed.

Home break-ins - Your phone can be used to disable smart home alarms and security cameras.

## Famous SIM Swapping Victims
- Many online influencers and celebrities have been targeted:

- Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey had his Twitter account hacked after his number was ported. The hackers then tweeted racial slurs and bomb threats.

- Investor Michael Terpin fell victim to a $23.8 million cryptocurrency theft thanks to SIM swappers tricking AT&T.

## Who Conducts SIM Swap Attacks?
Most SIM swappers are organized cybercriminals seeking big payouts, especially from cryptocurrency theft due to lax identity verification at many exchanges. They often recruit telecom industry employees to assist with number porting or sell the ported numbers on dark web markets. Individual hackers may also perform smaller one-off SIM swaps.

## How to Protect Yourself from SIM Swapping
### Here are some tips to safeguard against having your number swapped:

**1.** Use a unique PIN code with your carrier to prevent unauthorized SIM transfers.

**2.** Avoid using phone numbers for 2FA - opt for an authenticator app or physical security key instead.

**3.** Set up account alerts to detect unauthorized logins or password changes.

**4.** Limit sharing of your phone number online and enable call/text filtering if possible.

**5.** Utilize privacy services like that shield your phone number to deter number porting.

## Law Enforcement Response
While telecom carriers have strengthened identity verification, law enforcement continues targeting SIM swapping groups:

The REACT Task Force arrested numerous SIM swappers and recovered millions in stolen cryptocurrency.

Multiple SIM swap ringleaders have been arrested and charged with identity theft and extortion.

SIM swapping poses a serious threat in our increasingly mobile world. Following cautious practices around sharing and securing your phone number can help mitigate the risk of devastating account takeovers and financial theft. Protect yourself by understanding the dangers and available safeguards.

## Conclusion
